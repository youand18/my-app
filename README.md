## Instructions

0. This game is designed for two players, one to be the Red Squares and one to be the Blue Squares.
1. Red goes first, clicking to place their square on the board.
2. Blue follows, placing their square in the same manner.
3. Play continues in this order until one player gets four squares in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Alternatively, if every board position gets filled with a square and neither player has four in a row, the players tie the game.
